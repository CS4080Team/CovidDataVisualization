# CovidDataVisualization
This python project is a visual demonstration of the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic over the time frame
of Jan 22, 2020 to July 27, 2020. We decided to use python for its many libaries that are useful and easy to use 
for data science and visualization. This includes matplotlib for drawing the graphs, then numpy, pandas and statistics for mathematical operations, analysis and data manipulation.

## Covid-19 dataset
We used a dataset that can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report from kaggle.com.
This CSV file includes a variety of data including: date, confirmed cases, total deaths, total recovered, active cases, 
new cases, new daily deaths, new daily recovered, deaths per 100 people, recovered per 100 people, deaths per 100 people
recovered, and number of countries with at least 1 active case. We used this various data to create 5 different graphs that
each display a differnet interpretation of the spread of Covid.

## Running the project
To run this project, clone the repository to your local machine. Make sure python 3.0 or higher is installed. You can then navigate
to the directory in which you saved the repository to. You can then run python3 main.py from the command line or run it in your local
IDE. The program will then start, displaying the graphs one at a time.
