# CovidDataVisualization
This Python project is a visual demonstration of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic from Jan 22, 2020 to July 27, 2020.
We decided to use python for its many libraries that are useful and easy to use for data science and visualization.
This includes matplotlib for drawing the graphs, then numpy, pandas and statistics for mathematical operations,
analysis and data manipulation.

## COVID-19 dataset
We used a dataset that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report) from Kaggle.
This CSV file includes a variety of data including: date, confirmed cases, total deaths, total recovered, active cases, 
new cases, new daily deaths, new daily recovered, deaths per 100 people, recovered per 100 people, deaths per 100 people
recovered, and number of countries with at least 1 active case. We used this various data to create 5 different graphs
that each display a different interpretation of the spread of COVID.

## Running the project
To run this project, clone the repository to your local machine. Make sure Python 3.0 or higher is installed. You can
then navigate to the directory in which you saved the repository to. You can then run `python3 main.py` from the command
line or run it in your local IDE. The program will then start, displaying the graphs one at a time.
